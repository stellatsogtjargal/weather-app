# A simple weather app

Using OpenWeatherMap's Weather API, this app allows users to search for towns. Once searched, the app displays the current weather and daily weather of that town. Additionally, using the New York Times's Most Popular API, the app displays the most emailed NYT articles from the last day.

## Local setup instructions
